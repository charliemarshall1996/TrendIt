The homepage on desktop follows a simple, sleek design which allows users to search and filter trending posts, view trending posts and their related metrics, and perform various actions.

#### Desktop - Categories

The categories page on desktop allows users to not only select a category, but view extra detail concerning that category and how it is trending. Selecting a category takes the user back to the homepage, with the trending posts filtered by category.

### Mobile

#### Mobile - Index

On mobile, TrendIt is a single-page web app, which allows users to perform the same functions as on desktop. However, the categories page instead takes the form of a dropdown button in the header of the app. This omits the extra detail seen on desktop, to allow for a more cohesive mobile experience.
